# It is bult in data types that lets us create immutable sequences of values
tup = (1,2,3,4,5,6)
print(tup[1])
print(tup[2])

# tup[3] = 4 NOT allowed in python becoz it is immutable 

# Always seperate the tupple as ',' so it act as tupple onluy 
# t = (1,) #If there is no ',' then it will asct as normal int
# print(type(t))

# Scling in Tupple is same as the list 
print(tup[1:3])
